## Introduction

**PantryPal - Recipe** is a modern recipe discovery and kitchen management web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.

The idea behind PantryPal is simple: help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have in their kitchen. Instead of choosing a recipe first and then purchasing a long list of ingredients, PantryPal follows a pantry-first approach, allowing users to search for recipes using available ingredients and  discover recipes that best match what they have.

The application integrates the **Spoonacular API** for recipe data and provides features such as ingredient-based recipe discovery, personal pantry management, favorites, weekly meal planning, user profiles and preferences, and an AI-powered recipe assistant.

For personalized functionality, PantryPal uses **Firebase Authentication** for user accounts and **Cloud Firestore** for storing user-specific data. Users can create an account or sign in using Email/Password or Google, allowing their preferences, pantry items, favorite recipes, and other personalized data to be retained across sessions.

The application is deployed on **Vercel**, with a server-side API layer handling external recipe-service requests.

## Application Workflow

**PantryPal** follows a pantry-first workflow that takes users from ingredient selection to recipe discovery, preparation, and meal planning.

1️⃣ **Authentication and User Session**

- Users can continue as guests or create an account using **Email/Password** or **Google Sign-In**.
- Authenticated users can persist their pantry items, favorite recipes, meal plans, and preferences using **Firebase Authentication** and **Cloud Firestore**.

2️⃣ **Ingredient Selection and Pantry Management**

- Users enter ingredients through the ingredient search interface.
- The application provides ingredient suggestions to make selection faster.
- Authenticated users can load ingredients from their **saved pantry**.
- Users can add, edit, remove, and manage ingredients in their pantry.

3️⃣ **Ingredient-to-Recipe Matching**

- The selected ingredients are sent to the server-side API for recipe search.
- The backend retrieves recipe data from the **Spoonacular API**.
- Recipes are evaluated based on the ingredients available to the user.
- Results are ranked according to their **match percentage**, helping users identify recipes they can make with the ingredients they already have.

4️⃣ **Recipe Discovery and Filtering**

- Matching recipes are displayed as recipe cards with relevant information such as match percentage, meal category, preparation time, and difficulty.
- Users can refine results using available filters such as:
  - **Meal Type**
  - **Dietary Preferences**
  - **Cooking Time**
  - **Match Criteria**
- This allows users to quickly narrow the results to recipes that fit their requirements.

5️⃣ **Detailed Recipe View**

- Selecting a recipe opens its detailed recipe view.
- Users can compare available ingredients with the ingredients required by the recipe.
- Missing ingredients can be identified and added to the shopping list.
- Users can adjust serving sizes and view nutritional information.
- The recipe view also provides step-by-step cooking instructions.

6️⃣ **AI-Powered Recipe Assistant**

- Users can access the **Google Gemini-powered recipe assistant** while viewing a recipe.
- The assistant uses the recipe context to provide cooking-related guidance.
- Users can ask questions about ingredient substitutions, recipe modifications, preparation steps, and other cooking-related advice.

7️⃣ **Smart Shopping List**

- Missing ingredients from a recipe can be added directly to the **shopping list**.
- Users can manage the list by checking off purchased items and adding or removing ingredients as needed.

8️⃣ **Favorites and Weekly Meal Planner**

- Users can save recipes to their **Favorites** for quick access later.
- The **Weekly Meal Planner** allows users to assign recipes to specific days and meal slots throughout the week.
- Saved favorites and meal plans are synchronized for authenticated users through **Cloud Firestore**.

## AI-Assisted Development

**PantryPal** was initially developed with the assistance of **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini** during the early stages of the project.

AI assistance was used to support areas such as application structure, component development, UI implementation, debugging, and development guidance. The generated suggestions and code were subsequently reviewed, modified, integrated, and tested as part of the development process.

The final application reflects the project's implemented architecture, features, integrations, and deployment configuration, including **React**, **TypeScript**, **Firebase**, **Spoonacular API**, **Google Gemini API**, **Express**, and **Vercel**.
